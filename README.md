# Variant-discovery-using-transcriptomics-data

A study to identify novel genetic variants that might contribute to complex disease pathogenesis by leveraging cost-effective and publicly available RNA-seq data that captures variants in actively transcribed regions.

Follow the steps to download, discover the variants, normalize the data, and get pathogenicity predictions.

Each step have separate README.md files.
